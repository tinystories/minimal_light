## About

Welcome! I'm Emma, a full-time scientist and spare-time creative writer from Scotland. I write tiny stories called flash fiction.

My flash fiction has been published on websites such as [Nanoism](https://nanoism.net/stories/841/) and [101 Words](https://101words.org/the-fairy-ring/). In December 2019, I won the Scottish Book Trust's [50 Word Fiction Competition](https://www.scottishbooktrust.com/50-word-fiction/december-2019-winners).

I'm a member of my local writing group, [West Lothian Writers](https://www.westlothianwriters.org.uk/). Check out my writing below.
